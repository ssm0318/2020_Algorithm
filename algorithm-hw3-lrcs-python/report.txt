<Algorithm HW#3>

1. Basic logic of the program:
    The logic of this algorithm is essentially identical to the LCS Problem except that
    - the two given strings are reverse of each other and that
    - the condition for determining 'common' sequence is determined via the
    - `isComplementPair` method that returns `True` for complementary characters.

2. Execution related details:
    - How to Run: `python LRCS.py`
    - How to Modify the Input: add or modify the `files` list in the first line of this scope.
    - Where to Find the Output: `{input file name}-output.txt` for each file in the current directory.

    I tried to support the execution of multiple input test case files.
    Most details of the program are included in the program, as I assumed it would be easier to interpret than a separate report.
    I tried my best to make the program self-explanatory, so please refer to `LRCS.py` if there are any necessary details missing in this report.

    Thank you :)
